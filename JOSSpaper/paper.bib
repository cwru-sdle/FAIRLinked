A diverse set of stakeholders---representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers---have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

	abstract = {Ontologies have gained popularity in the scientific community as a way to standardize terminologies in organizations' data. Although certain cohorts have created frameworks with rules and guidelines on creating ontologies, there exist significant variations in how Materials Science ontologies are currently developed. We seek to provide guidance in the form of a unified automated framework for developing interoperable and modular~ontologies for Materials Data Science that~simplifies the ontology terms matching by establishing a semantic bridge up to the Basic Formal Ontology(BFO). This framework provides key recommendations on how ontologies should be positioned within the semantic web, what knowledge representation language is recommended, and where ontologies should be published online to boost their findability and interoperability. Two fundamental components of the MDS-Onto framework are the bilingual package called FAIRmaterials for ontology creation and FAIRLinked, for FAIR data creation. To showcase the practical capabilities of FAIRmaterials, we present two exemplar domain ontologies of MDS-Onto: Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction and Photovoltaics.},

	abstract = {A foundational set of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) principles were proposed in 2016 as prerequisites for proper data management and stewardship, with the goal of enabling the reusability of scholarly data. The principles were also meant to apply to other digital assets, at a high level, and over time, the FAIR guiding principles have been re-interpreted or extended to include the software, tools, algorithms, and workflows that produce data. FAIR principles are now being adapted in the context of AI models and datasets. Here, we present the perspectives, vision, and experiences of researchers from different countries, disciplines, and backgrounds who are leading the definition and adoption of FAIR principles in their communities of practice, and discuss outcomes that may result from pursuing and incentivizing FAIR AI research. The material for this report builds on the FAIR for AI Workshop held at Argonne National Laboratory on June 7, 2022.}

Due to these practices, historical data are rarely leveraged in future studies, but rather are frequently forgotten on a local computer or hardware. We describe a data-driven study protocol design to overcome such challenges in research investigations and to garner the maximum value of available and existing data. A study protocol focuses on the importance and lifespan of data beyond a study where data is re-used to generate new insights. We outline management strategies to ensure that data and metadata, including historical results, are properly linked and recorded using the domain-driven ontologies and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) guiding principles.},

In this work, we address the challenge of data registration between multiple modalities. Large data spaces must be organized in a machine-compatible method to maximize scientific output. FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles are required to overcome challenges associated with data at various scales. FAIRified data enables a standardized format allowing for opportunities to generate automated extraction methods and scalability. We establish a framework that captures and integrates data from a L-PBF study such as radiography and high-speed camera video, linking these data sets cohesively allowing for future exploration.},

	abstract = {The prosperity and lifestyle of our society are very much governed by achievements in condensed matter physics, chemistry and materials science, because new products for sectors such as energy, the~environment, health, mobility and information technology (IT) rely largely~on improved or even new materials. Examples include solid-state lighting, touchscreens, batteries, implants, drug delivery and many more. The enormous amount of research data produced every day in these fields represents a gold mine of the twenty-first century. This gold mine is, however, of little value if these data are not comprehensively characterized and made available. How can we refine this feedstock; that is, turn data into knowledge and value? For this, a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data 'findable and AI ready' (a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which science is carried out today. In this Perspective, we discuss how we can~prepare to make this happen for the field of materials science.},

  abstract = {Knowledge graphs are often constructed from heterogeneous data sources, using declarative rules that map them to a target ontology and materializing them into RDF. When these data sources are large, the materialization of the entire knowledge graph may be computationally expensive and not suitable for those cases where a rapid materialization is required. In this work, we propose an approach to overcome this limitation, based on the novel concept of mapping partitions. Mapping partitions are defined as groups of mapping rules that generate disjoint subsets of the knowledge graph. Each of these groups can be processed separately, reducing the total amount of memory and execution time required by the materialization process. We have included this optimization in our materialization engine Morph-KGC, and we have evaluated it over three different benchmarks. Our experimental results show that, compared with state-of-the-art techniques, the use of mapping partitions in Morph-KGC presents the following advantages: (i) it decreases significantly the time required for materialization, (ii) it reduces the maximum peak of memory used, and (iii) it scales to data sizes that other engines are not capable of processing currently.},
