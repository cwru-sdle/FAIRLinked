Introduction
==========

FAIRLinked is a software package developed to support the FAIRification of materials science data, ensuring alignment with the principles of 
Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. 
It is built around MDS-Onto,an ontology designed to capture the semantics, structure, and relationships inherent to materials 
data, thereby enabling integration, sharing, and reuse across diverse research workflows.

This tool is actively developed and maintained by the **SDLE Research Center at Case Western Reserve University** and is used in 
multiple federally funded projects.
